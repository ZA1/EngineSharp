# EngineSharp

## Introduction

This is an attempt at something akin to a reference implementation in C# for integrating with our Engine Property API.
It's not feature-complete, but it does handle the most common API transactions, and should serve as a solid starting
point for integrators to work from.

Any comments or suggestions can be sent to support@engine.co.za
